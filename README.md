# Human Gait Analysis & Recognition

This project provides an overview of **Human Gait Analysis and Recognition**, including techniques, algorithms, and applications in healthcare, security, sports, and elder care. The project presents a concise slide deck that explains the fundamental concepts and approaches used in gait analysis.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

Human Gait Analysis is the study of human walking patterns, aiming to understand, diagnose, and recognize individuals based on their gait. It has critical applications in:

* **Healthcare**: Rehabilitation and medical diagnosis.
* **Security**: Biometric identification.
* **Sports**: Performance improvement and injury prevention.
* **Elder Care**: Fall detection and health monitoring.

This project was prepared as part of the **Pattern Recognition** course.

## ðŸ‘£ Key Concepts

* **Walking Mechanics**: Understanding the gait cycle phases (stance and swing).
* **Gait Analysis Techniques**:

  * Motion capture
  * Wearable sensors
  * Video analysis
  * AI algorithms
* **Algorithms in Gait Recognition**:

  * Silhouette Shape-Based Algorithms
  * Temporal Alignment
  * Static Parameters
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  * Gait Energy Image (GEI)
  * Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFCF)

## ðŸ”¬ Silhouette Shape-Based Algorithms Workflow

1. **Silhouette Extraction**
2. **Feature Extraction** (e.g., width, area, Hu moments)
3. **Gait Cycle Analysis**
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** (e.g., PCA)
5. **Classification** (e.g., SVM, Neural Networks)
6. **Challenges** (e.g., clothing variations, background clutter, viewpoint changes)

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion

Human Gait Analysis leverages advanced sensing and AI technologies to enable accurate recognition of individuals based on their walking patterns. While powerful, gait recognition faces challenges such as variations in clothing and camera perspectives.
